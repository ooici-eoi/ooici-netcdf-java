Hi Paul:

We havent been able to find any reference to 3-03-192 or 0-00-021 through 0-00-077.

Even if a local descriptor like 3-03-192 was in an NCDC table, it would also have to be in an FSL local table, since the software wouldnt know that it should use a table from another center.

The use of 0-00-021 through 0-00-077 may be wrong, since those are reserved for WMO (not local) descriptors. Its possible Mark used some proposed RAOB encoding that was eventually modified or not accepted. If he can find a reference to that, I would appreciate hearing about it. I couldnt find anything in a google search.

anyway, we will put these into the "cannot decode" box for now. thanks for your help.

John
