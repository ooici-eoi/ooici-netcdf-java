5/22/2007 JC mlode and modev:idd/radars.xml
  add nexrad composite 1km, as both an aggregation and a DatasetScan.
  rearrange services, clean up a bit.

5/12/2007 JC mlode: remove NetcdfServer service from idd/allModels.TDS-nc.xml.
   This is not (yet) valid on netcdf files, and generates an exception in catalina.out (no return in threddsServlet.log).
