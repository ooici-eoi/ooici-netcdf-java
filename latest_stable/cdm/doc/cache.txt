1. NetcdfFile must be invariant. its location must be unique. so you cant open it with variations.
If you are going to modify the object or the file, dont use acquire() !! except for ncfile.synch() !

2. NetcdfDataset can be used to modify / enhance a NetcdfFile. It should not touch the NetcdfFile. It keeps
 its own object lists. VariableDS wraps Varaible, shares cache.
 Dimension, Attributes should never be modifued.

3. NcML will modify / enhance a NetcdfFile, so it does not use acquire. Tradeoff??


----
NetcdfDataset

NetcdfDataset.acquireFile();
NetcdfDataset.acquire();

NetcdfDataset.open( NetcdfFile ncfile); ok to acquire or open ncfile.

----

ship with cache disabled.
call init() to enable. use acquire. reccommended for enterprise projects.
clearCache( force) to clean up files you forgot to close. better to track these down and close the leak.
