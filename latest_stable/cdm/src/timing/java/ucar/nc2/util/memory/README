 The MemoryCounterAgent class uses the Java instrumentation API to predict
 the amount of memory taken up by an object. The code was taken from the
 Java Specialist newsletter #142 "Instrumentation Memory Counter",
 http://www.javaspecialists.eu/archive/Issue142.html.

The build.xml builds the code and places the jar file (memoryagent.jar) in
this directory. To use this in testing, write code that constructs an object
and hand that object to "MemoryCounterAgent.sizeOf(Object)" and/or
"MemoryCounterAgent.deepSizeOf(Object)".

To run the test program, use the following java command-line option:

 -javaagent:src/timing/java/ucar/nc2/util/memory/memoryagent.jar
